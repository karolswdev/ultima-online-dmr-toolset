# Ultima Online Dream Masters Revolution tools

This repository contains tools that are useful for developing and maintaining [the main shard](https://www.github.com/karolswdev/ultima-online-dmr). Most of those tools are in binary format, as they are 3rd party tools. None of the tools contains any kind of virus.

## GM Tools

 * **DoHInstaller.zip** - A great tool created in the early 2000s for managing Ultima Online from the perspective of a Game Master. Has tons of definitions of items and so on. Must have! Download [here](gm_tools/DoHInstaller.zip?raw=true), or clone repository and find it in the **gm_tools** folder.

 ## Development Tools

* In **VSCode** - make sure you to download *POLScript Language Support* - does wonders.

* **GumpEditor** - A great tool that works with our Gumps library! Great way to create sadly, I lost the source to this great tool, but it still works well. Requires *Java Runtime*. Should run on Linux and Mac OS but I have only tested it on Windows. Make sure to change the file **config.xml** to point to your UO installation.

    **.gep** files in this folder are example gumps I made for you to practice with.
